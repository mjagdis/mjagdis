===========

Due to GitHub policies, Copilot, etc. most of the repositories here are effectively
frozen and will only receive updates to facilitate the creation of pull requests
where repositories fork other GitHub-hosted repositories.

Current versions of the active repositories (and more!) can be found at
<http://www.eris-associates.co.uk/git>
